# Narraza v3 — Master Progress Checklist (M0–M8)

Living checklist derived from `docs/implementation-plan.md` so **tidak ada yang
terlewat**. Update the boxes as work lands. This tracks _coverage_; the binding
truth for each item stays in `implementation-plan.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and
`verification-matrix.md`.

**Legend:** `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress / in open PR · `[ ]` not started.
**Model** column = the user's Opus/Fable discipline (remind before each task).
**Order is a hard sequence** M0→M8 (§15); only W6.1 / W4.3 fixtures / W7.1 may be
started early.

## Milestone status

| M | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repo, scaffold, auth, shell, CI | ✅ **done** (merged `master`, 8 CI checks green, branch protection on) |
| M1 | Domain core & critical schema | 🔄 W1.1–W1.5 merged to `master` (PR #1–#5); exit gate M1 still open (S3/S7 unit coverage + migration drift re-check) |
| M2 | Ports, UnitOfWork, user-origin flow | 🔄 W2.1–W2.4 landed on `feat/m2-ports-uow` (Draft PR); **exit gate open**: manual smoke, `idor` e2e, `concept-accept` seeded, tenant-scope review, CI 8 checks |
| M3 | Jobs, worker, outbox, credit | ⬜ not started |
| M4 | AI layer (mock + real adapters) | ⬜ not started |
| M5 | Proposal accept, working draft, validation | ⬜ not started |
| M6 | Full UI, design system, a11y, e2e | ⬜ not started |
| M7 | Staging hardening | ⬜ not started |
| M8 | Production deploy & launch | ⬜ not started |

## M1 — Domain core & critical schema

- [x] **W1.1 Full schema + raw SQL** _(Fable)_ — merged PR #1
  - [x] All Lampiran B tables via expand-only migrations (48 models)
  - [x] Raw SQL: partial unique `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`; composite FK `(beat_id, accepted_prose_version_id)`; CHECK enums/status; key indexes (job claim, ledger dedupe, belief fold)
  - [x] N-1 fixture + `migrate-upgrade`; drift check
  - [x] Tests: `soft-delete-unique`, `prose-fk` (+ schema-inventory, credit-integrity, quality-gaps)
  - [x] **Merge PR #1 to `master`**
  - [ ] _Optional follow-up:_ comment the circular-FK insert order (job↔reservation, candidate↔prose, quote↔plan) + drop no-op `generated_candidates_job_project_guard` CHECK
- [x] **W1.2 Core values & policies** _(Fable)_ — merged PR #2
  - [x] `NarrativePosition {chapterId, beatId?, sequence}` + comparator
  - [x] `reveal-policy`: reveal+breadcrumbs+position → writer-guidance (safe) vs restricted guard set; truth never in guidance
  - [x] `expression-policy`: non-POV → behavioral directives, not raw belief
  - [x] `knowledge-policy`: belief-stream fold (sequence, createdAt, id); downgrade needs allowed reason
  - [x] `disclosure-policy`: fold FactDisclosure → ReaderFactState + retraction target
  - [x] `readiness-policy` (D5): weighted checklist → {percent, checklist[], nextRecommendation}
  - [x] `dependency-manifest`: canonical serialization (stable sort) + schema-version prefix + SHA-256; reject dup (entityType, entityId)
  - [x] `stale-policy`: dependency change → needs_revalidation|stale; global bump alone does NOT invalidate
  - [x] `prose-policy`, `repair-policy` (stop OR: resolved/limit/no-progress/repeat/regression)
  - [x] Tests: `expression-policy`, `belief-transition`, `disclosure-fold`, `foundation-readiness`, `dependency-hash`, `repair-policy`

  - [x] Tests: `writer-packet-leak`, `writer-guidance-safe`
- [x] **W1.4 Deterministic validator** _(Fable)_ — merged PR #4
  - [x] Structural beat-contract checks; restricted-representation matcher (exact/alias/co-occurrence/proximity → matched|suspected|requires_semantic_review)
  - [x] `merge-findings`: AI only adds; deterministic blockers can't be removed/downgraded; `passed = no blocking`
  - [x] `toPublicFinding`: strip restrictedDetail → publicMessageCode
  - [x] Tests: `merge-findings`, adversarial fixtures for `prompt-injection-guard` (policy level)
- [x] **W1.5 Operation layers** _(Fable)_ — merged PR #5
  - [x] 3 type layers `ModelSuggestionDraft → NormalizedOperationDraft → CanonicalChangeOperation` (`op-type-boundary`)
  - [x] Resolution: ID alloc, tempRef, DAG + topo-sort, operationsHash; system-derived fields
  - [x] Allowlist ops + max counts per contract; `prose.accept` always last
  - [x] Tests: `op-type-boundary`, `tempref-resolve`, `op-allowlist`, `prose-accept-order` (unit), `repair-reextract` (unit)
- **Exit gate M1**
  - [x] All S3/S7 unit tests in verification matrix green (core unit: 670 tests)

- [x] **W2.1 Ports & UnitOfWork (D9)** _(Fable)_ — landed `feat/m2-ports-uow`
  - [x] Port interfaces: Project/Foundation/Character/Fact/Outline/Reveal/Proposal/ChangeSet repos + Ledger/Audit/Outbox/Snapshot/Job (stub) ports
  - [x] `unitOfWork.execute(fn, opts?)`: read-committed default; serializable opt-in; bounded retry (3, jitter, same requestId); tx-scoped ports
  - [x] Prisma repos implement ports; `dbNow` helper
- [x] **W2.2 Single write door** _(Fable)_
  - [x] `commitCanonicalChangeSet`: validate → apply canon → bump revisions → `currentCanonicalVersion += 1` (once) → Audit + Outbox
  - [x] User-origin proposal path (fact/reveal/outline) → ChangeSet `origin=user`
  - [x] Tests: `fact-lifecycle`, `accept-proposal` (base: +1 per change set)
- [~] **W2.3 Use cases + Server Actions** _(Opus)_ — all `authorizeActiveUser` + tenant scope
  - [x] `createProject(jalur)` → project + intake session + opening template
  - [x] `appendIntakeMessage` (persist only; AI reply = M4)
  - [x] Foundation: `updateFoundationDraft`, `confirmFoundation`, `lockFoundation` (readiness guard + confirm)
  - [x] Character CRUD; Fact CRUD via change set; Reveal + breadcrumbs CRUD (author_private)
  - [x] Outline CRUD strict; `outline-downstream` guard (accepted-prose beats reject plain upsert)
  - [x] Tests: `outline-downstream`, `active-user-guard`
  - [ ] Tests: **`concept-accept` (seeded)** — required M2 exit gate (AI gen deferred M4; seeded accept remains M2)
  - [ ] Tests: **`idor` (e2e)** — security invariant; required M2 exit gate (not deferred polish)
- [x] **W2.4 Progress reducer v1 + plain pages** _(Opus)_
  - [x] `ProjectProgressView → {stage, blockers[], nextAction, counts}` (`progress-view`)
  - [x] Functional (unpolished) pages: dashboard filled/empty, project home, foundation, character, fact, outline, reveal, chat
- **Exit gate M2** _(hard — do not start M3 until closed)_
  - [ ] Manual flow: create → chat persists → foundation → lock → outline 10 chapters — works in browser
  - [x] `fact-lifecycle`, `outline-downstream`, `progress-view`, canon +1 green locally
  - [ ] `idor` e2e green (tenant other → NOT_FOUND; project/foundation/fact/reveal/outline)
  - [ ] `concept-accept` seeded green (fixture concept → foundation draft, not locked)
  - [ ] No query without tenant scope (PR review checklist)
  - [ ] Draft PR open; 8 required CI checks green; ready-for-review only after gate complete

- [ ] **W3.3 Credit engine (S2.6 + D4 + D6)** _(Fable)_
  - [ ] Ledger append-only + dedupe; reservations + closing; `safeRelease ≥ 0`; exposure exceeded → ops incident
  - [ ] `issueCreditQuote` bound to workflowPlanHash+dependencyHash+maxMicroIdr+expiry(10m); consume once
  - [ ] Confirm: revalidate owner/quote/hash/balance → jobId + reserve → enqueue (idempotent by requestId)

  - [ ] Mock job end-to-end from UI: quote → confirm → phases → success/fail → credit consistent; refresh mid → recover
  - [ ] All S8 + credit matrix tests green
  - [ ] `kill -9` worker mid-job → correct reclaim, no double publish (manual + fence test)

---

  - [ ] Explicit version + content hash; delimiter-wrap user content; zod `.strict()`; parse-repair path
  - [ ] Judge → publicMessageCode (+internalRationale restricted)

- [ ] **W4.4 Model policy (D14)** _(Fable — security/governance decision)_
  - [ ] `packages/ai/model-policy.ts` + `docs/model-policy.md`; restricted packet → allowlist only, else config error
  - [ ] Test: `model-policy-allowlist`
  - [ ] **Gate:** final no-training/no-retention provider list reviewed & signed by owner
- [ ] **W4.5 Real adapters** _(Opus)_ — OpenRouter + Gemini (normalized errors, timeout, usage); env-gated; first used staging M7
- [ ] **W4.6 Wire product workflows** _(Opus)_
  - [ ] Intake reply (free fair-use D4, no card); signal extraction → sufficiency indicator
  - [ ] Concept-gen (3) → pick → foundation draft (`concept-accept` full)
  - [ ] Foundation-fill, character-build, outline-10 → proposals (Accept/Edit/Reject), not direct canon
  - [ ] Beat-write: writer→judge in one plan; 1–3 candidates → GeneratedCandidate
  - [ ] Repair: sanitized directives → new version+proposal; full re-extraction
  - [ ] Publish-package → ArtifactProposal

## M5 — Proposal accept, working draft, validation binding

- [ ] **W5.1 Working draft & versions** _(Opus, CAS pattern from M2/M3)_
  - [ ] `ProseWorkingDraft` per (user, beat) unique; autosave CAS revision; conflict → DTO
  - [ ] Snapshot → immutable `ProseVersion` (revision + content hash); pick candidate = seed draft
  - [ ] Test: `working-draft`
- [ ] **W5.2 Validation & repair binding** _(Fable/Opus)_
  - [ ] `ValidationReport` bound (proseVersionId, proseContentHash, policyVersion); deterministic validator + AI judge (merge-findings)
  - [ ] Edit draft → hash change → report stale (`validation-hash`)
  - [ ] Override only server-allowlisted findings + reason (`override-allowlist`)
  - [ ] Safe Repair orchestration: stop conditions, before/after, result = new ProseVersion + Proposal, never auto-accept
- [ ] **W5.3 Full atomic accept (S4.4)** _(Fable, no compromise)_
  - [ ] Lock proposal+group+project → ownership → status guard → stale decision → supersede pre-check → eligibility → CAS ops → bump revisions → canon +1 once → accept + supersede siblings → audit/outbox
  - [ ] CAS fail → new tx conditional `WHERE status='pending'` → stale
  - [ ] User-edited prose → Proposal `source=user` + re-extraction
  - [ ] Publish artifact accept without canon bump
  - [ ] Tests: `accept-proposal`, `accept-cas-stale`, `accept-supersede`, `proposal-unrelated-version-bump`, `user-proposal`, `publish-artifact`, `prose-accept-order` (integration), `proposal-dto` (contract)

  - [ ] Reducer covers all stages to publish; nextAction per page; sidebar badges
  - [ ] Deterministic intake sufficiency → CTA "Susun 3 Konsep"
- **Exit gate M5**
  - [ ] Full mock flow: intake → concept → foundation lock → outline → write → check → repair → accept → manuscript → publish — from UI, no manual DB
  - [ ] All S2/S4/S7/S9 invariants (proposal/canon/draft/validation) green

## Cross-cutting gates (don't forget)

- [ ] **§2 functional map** — the CLOSED scope contract: every prototype page/state → mechanism → milestone. Audited row-by-row at M6 and M8.
- [ ] **verification-matrix.md** — every invariant → test → CI job. Keep it the single source; add a row before implementing a new invariant.
- [ ] **No internal strings in UI** (`no-internal-strings`, `proposal-dto`) — enforced continuously.
- [ ] **Model discipline** — remind Opus/Fable before each workstream (see the milestone table above).
